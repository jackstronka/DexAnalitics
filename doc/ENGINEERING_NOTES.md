# Engineering notes (code changes)

**Purpose:** short, **append-only** entries whenever someone (or AI) makes a **non-trivial** code change. Optimized for **grep and semantic search**: each entry has a **`keywords:`** line with comma-separated tokens (crates, domains, CLI flags, protocols).

**When to add an entry**

- New or removed public CLI subcommand / important flag.
- Behavioral change in backtest, optimization, execution, or protocol adapters.
- New dependency, breaking RPC/data format assumption, or migration of on-disk layout under `data/`.
- Anything you would explain to a teammate in standup — if it touches multiple files or user-visible behavior, log it here.

**Skip** for: typo fixes, pure refactors with no behavior change, one-line test-only edits.

**Order:** **newest first** (add new `##` sections at the **top**, right under this preamble).

<!--
Template — copy, fill, paste above the line "---" that follows the newest entry.

## YYYY-MM-DD — Short title (what you did)

**keywords:** crate-name, domain, orca|raydium|meteora, cli-flag, topic
**crates:** clmm-lp-cli, …
**paths:** `crates/.../file.rs` (optional; main touch points)

2–4 sentences: what changed, why, impact. If breaking: say **BREAKING:** explicitly.
